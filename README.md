# Lift3 CMS (Internship Project – 2023)

During my third-year internship at [Lift3](https://lift3.nl), I developed a new internal CMS using Laravel
to replace an outdated PHP system. The focus was on backend architecture, maintainability,
and improving the user interface.

## Preview
Below are some screenshots of the interface (no internal data).
